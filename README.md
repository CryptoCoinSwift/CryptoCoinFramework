CoinKey
=======
Swift component for private keys, public keys, and addresess for crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin.

Introduction
============
The CryptoCoinSwift project is inspired by [CryptoCoinJS](http://cryptocoinjs.com) and tries the follow the same class organization. CryptoCoinJS adheres to the UNIX philosophy - "the idea of building small components that do one thing and do it well". It includes tons of tests which should make it easier to reproduce its functionality.

CryptoCoinSwift is designed for the [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) programming language for iOs and Mac and uses [Playgrounds](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/recipes/xcode_help-source_editor/ExploringandEvaluatingSwiftCodeinaPlayground/ExploringandEvaluatingSwiftCodeinaPlayground.html) for documentation.

CryptoCoinSwift does not depend on OpenSSL.

The current implementation is extremely limited in functionality and is only tested with iOs. If you're in a hurry to build an app, you should look for an alternative.
